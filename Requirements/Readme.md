# Requirements
## Introduction
  1.Ride-sharing, or shared mobility, is an “innovative transportation strategy that enables users to gain short-term access to transportation modes on an as-needed basis.” It can include various forms of transportation, such as car-sharing, bike-sharing, carpooling and platform-based ride services (e.g., Uber, Lyft, BlaBlaCar).
  
  2.he objective of this project is to create a code as a prototype for an  application for ride sharing which would bring travel cost of both passesnger and the owner less.
  
  3.The topic was chosen because it will help me to implement various coding practices learnt.

## Benifits
* Some benifits of Ride Sharing system are listed.
   * Minimises travel cost.
   * Easy booking proccess.
   * Saves time.

## Defining Our System
  1.Choice of beign driver or passenger.
  2.Driver and Passengers details collection.
  3.Saving records.
  4.Checking availability.
  5.Fare calculation.
## Assumptions
  * The last driver details is only store(text file),could be further modified as a database to store multiple records
  * Route is considered to have 26 stops from a to z.
  * system takes driver name,starting point,ending point and then readiness to shere.If passenger's route lies within the driver's
    route,the ride is alloted.
  * Estimated fare is calculated based of passenger's start and end point.
